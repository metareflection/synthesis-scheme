# Scheme Synthesis in Scheme

- [`eval.scm`](eval.scm): evaluator
- [`bottomup.scm`](bottomup.scm): bottom-up synthesizer
- [`dan.scm`](dan.scm): synthesizer for recursive functions in the style taught by Dan Friedman
- [`topdown.scm`](topdown.scm): a top-down synthesizer based on scoring partial programs using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- [`topdown-without-mcts.scm`](topdown-without-mcts.scm): the delta of a top-down synthesizer that does not use MCTS
- [`mcmc.scm`](mcmc.scm): a stand-alone experiment with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) synthesis
